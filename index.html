                    <h3>Cinematographer/Editor</h3>
                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p>Sanjeet Singh is a cinematographer/filmmaker currently based in India, 
                        previously based in Germany. A highly adept DOP with around 5 years of 
                        experience. Originally from Kanpur, he has worked across the length & breadth 
                        of India and various parts of Europe. His love for the visual medium propels his 
                        craft, and helps in creation of something meaningful for the viewer. His 
                        strongest suit still remains his conviction and belief in whatever is required for 
                        the project and understanding the basic philosophy of collective-collaborative 
                        effort in order to create. He recently completed his M.A. in Cinematography 
                        from MET FILM School, Berlin.</p>
